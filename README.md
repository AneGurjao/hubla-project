# Upload File Project Hubla

Thanks for the opportunity and I apologize if I missed any requirements, this week that I developed this project was extremely busy, anything you can tell me and I can review it.

- This project was developing the frontend in :
   - React-Vite;
   - Typescript;
   - Testing library;
   - Cypress;
   - Node --version v20.5.0
     
- The Testing library was installed for unit tests and Cypress for acceptance tests, but unfortunately they do not have 100% coverage.

## Features
